A collection of functions and monads for functional programming in dart.

Includes:

- Function extensions - `chain` and `compose`.
- `Option`
- `Either`
- `Task`
- `TaskEither`
- `TaskOption`
- Immutable data structures, thanks to: https://pub.dev/packages/fast_immutable_collections
- Iterable extension helpers
- `Unit`

Note that the API will be unstable until version `0.1.0` is reached.

## Documentation

API docs: https://pub.dev/documentation/fpdt/latest/

Not every function is documented (help is welcome!), but progress is being made.

The `example/` and `test/` directories are also useful for seeing how this
library can be used.
